This plugin allows you to add the official LOVEFiLM widget to the sidebar of your Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

Easily and quickly integrate the LOVEFiLM Widget into your website. This plugin enables you to monetize your website through the use of LOVEFiLM's Affiliate or Share the LOVE Program. By selecting either program you will earn referral fees for each LOVEFiLM sign up through your website. 
The plugin displays the latest and most popular film or games titles and comes with customisable width and colour themes.
By popular demand, the Plugin now features contextualisation. An individual title can be selected and featured within the widget.  Support for a simple 'sign up' message at the footer of each article is now supported increasing sign up potential.
