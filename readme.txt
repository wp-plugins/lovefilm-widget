This plugin allows you to add the official LOVEFiLM widget to the sidebar of your Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

Easily and quickly integrate the LOVEFiLM Widget into your website. This plugin enables you to monetize your website through the use of LOVEFiLM's Affiliate or Share the LOVE Program. By selecting either program you will earn referral fees for each LOVEFiLM sign up through your website. 
The plugin displays the latest and most popular film or games titles and comes with customisable width and colour themes.
By popular demand, the Plugin now features contextualisation. An individual title can be selected and featured within the widget.  Support for a simple 'sign up' message at the footer of each article is now supported increasing sign up potential.
This plugin fully supports [LOVEFiLM.com](http://www.lovefilm.com/) at the present time with other LOVEFiLM territories being offered in the near future.

Note: Any potential problems with the Plugin can usually be solved by deactivating and reactivating. In most cases this will 'trip' the plugin into reregistering with LOVEFiLM and should fix any problems.
Note: Note that copy and pasting content from Word into WordPress may carry over "invisible" characters that make it difficult for the Context Search features of the LOVEFiLM Widget to locate films and games. If you have any problems try cleaning your pasted content by copying it into Notepad first, then copy and paste it into WordPress.
Note: Due to a TinyMCE issue, to use the Contextual functionality on IE9, please switch IE to 'Compatability Mode' for Wordpress versions 2.9 and 3.0.

== Installation ==

[Watch how to install and set up the widget](http://www.lovefilm.com/partnership/widgets#installvideo) or follow the steps below:

1.	Install the plugin from within the Dashboard or upload the lovefilm folder and all its contents to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2.	Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3.	Drag and drop the widget onto your sidebar. Go to 'appearance' then 'widgets'
4.	Edit your preferences in the 'LOVEFiLM Widget' settings panel
5.	If you have the W3 Total Cache plugin installed, be sure that it is configured correctly, with all the required Apache modules installed, as this has been known to affect other plugins such as the LOVEFiLM Plugin. Alternatively, disable JS Minify Settings in W3 Total Cache as this can break other plugins if misconfigured, including the LOVEFiLM Plugin.
